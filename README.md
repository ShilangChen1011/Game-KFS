# Game-KFS
This project is developed to implement a game-theoretic keyframe selection method for cross-representation visual SLAM. The corresponding paper is titled **"Game-KFS: Game-Theoretic Keyframe Selection for Cross-Representation Visual SLAM."**

## The code will be released once the paper is accepted.
